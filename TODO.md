* reimplement lang0

* leftmost strategy can find the normal form
  * find the leftmost subterm of (MN) form, where M is a Fn


* try beta reduction without closure
  * we don't need env anymore
  * learn some reduction policy
  * convert any lambda expression into normal form
  * define can be supported during parsing i.e. string substitution

## beta reduction
the correct form: an application form whose left-hand side is an abstract form
appendix c is what i'am looking for
